# infinite-canvas

Simple handwritten notes web editor with infinite canvas. Made with graphics tablets in mind.

## How it started

Recently I found myself in a need for a handwritten notes editor (I have a graphics tablet). My requirements were:

1. No input lag.
2. Infinite canvas.
3. Ability to comfortably export to image with transparency.

I found out that no such software exists on Mac OS (still can't believe it, let me know for example on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) if you know such thing) so I decided to try building it on my own. [Quick experiment](https://twitter.com/tchayen/status/1308542680671100934?s=20) proved that 1. is possible so I went to explore the other two.
